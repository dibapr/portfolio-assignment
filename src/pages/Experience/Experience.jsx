        <h3>PT. Testindo Indonesia (October 2018 - December 2018)</h3>
        <p style={{ margin: "0.5em 0" }}>
          Testindo is an Indonesian company that implements clean management and
          is engaged in the business of control technology and monitoring
          systems, measurement and testing.
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: "0.5em 0" }}>
          I have completed vocational high school internship / PKL (Praktek
          Kerja Lapangan) in PT Testindo for two months as Creative Staff with a
          result of A (as attached in my certificate).
        </p>
        <p style={{ margin: "0.5em 0" }}>
          During the internship program, I was responsible for making an opening
          video bumper for their YouTube Channel and designing a graphic poster
          for their product advertisement. Through this experience, I gained a
          better understanding of how to work as a team and the work
          environment. I also improved my design and video editing. I am very
          grateful for the opportunity to intern at this amazing company and
          feel ready to apply the skills I have acquired to future projects.
